Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. Save each
program with a filename that follows standard Python conventions, using
lowercase letters and underscores, such as simple_message.py and simple
_messages.py.

Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new
message.

1. [x] 2-3. Personal Message: <br>
    Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print
a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric,
would you like to learn some Python today?”

   Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the
quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the

<br>

1. [x] 2-6. Famous Quote 2: <br>
     Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the
famous person’s name using a variable called famous_person. Then compose
your message and represent it with a new variable called message. Print your
message.

<br>

1. [x] 2-7. Stripping Names: <br>
    Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include
some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure
you use each character combination,` "\t"` and `"\n"`, at least once.
Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, `lstrip()`,
`rstrip()`, and `strip()`.

<br>

1. [x] 2-8. Number Eight: <br>
     Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations
in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
``` python
print(5+3)
```
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once
on each line.

1. [x] 2-10. Adding Comments: <br>
     Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and
add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and
the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
describing what the program does.
